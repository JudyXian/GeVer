PROMPT = "## You are a question decomposition master. I have four types of problem decomposition templates, \
respectively bridge-from, bridge-where, bridge-not and combination.\
your task is to determine whether a question needs to be decomposed, and if so, select one template for the question decomposition \
from these four types of templates for the given natural language problem. \n\
## Below I will give some examples of problems that are suitable for decomposition using each of the four types of templates:\n\n\
\
Question: Show the status of the city that has hosted the greatest number of competitions.\n\
Need decompose: Yes\n\
Template_type: bridge-from\n\n\
\
Question: List the states and number of invoices in the US.\n\
Need decompose: No\n\
\
Question: Show all locations and the number of gas stations in each location ordered by the count.\n\
Need decompose: Yes\n\
Template_type: bridge-from\n\n\
\
Question: Return the effective date of the claim that has the largest total settlement amount in 'tb1'.\n\
Need decompose: No\n\
\
Question: What are the first and last names of all the employees and how many people report to them?\n\
Need decompose: Yes\n\
Template_type: bridge-from\n\n\
\
Question: What is the average bike availability in stations that are not located in Palo Alto?\n\
Need decompose: Yes\n\
Template_type: bridge-not\n\n\
\
Question: List the first and last name of the students who do not have any food type allergy.\n\
Need decompose: Yes\n\
Template_type: bridge-not\n\n\
\
Question: What is the average bike availabiliy in stations which not in 'tb1'?\n\
Need decompose: No\n\
\
Question: Find the average rating star for each movie that not in 'tb1'.\n\
Need decompose: No\n\
\
Question: On which day and in which zip code was the min dew point lower than any day in zip code 94107?\n\
Need decompose: Yes\n\
Template_type: bridge-where\n\n\
\
Question: On which day and in which zip code the min dew point was less than 'value1'?\n\
Need decompose: No\n\
\
Question: Return the effective date of the claim that has the largest total settlement amount in 'tb1'.\n\
Need decompose: Yes\n\
Template_type: bridge-where\n\n\
\
Question: Return the average price of all products.\n\
Need decompose: No\n\
\
Question: Find the team names of the universities whose enrollments are smaller than the average enrollment size.\n\
Need decompose: Yes\n\
Template_type: bridge-where\n\n\
\
Question: What are the different models created by either the car maker General Motors or weighed more than 3500?\n\
Need decompose: Yes\n\
Template_type: combination\n\n\
\
Question: List the states where both the secretary of 'Treasury' department and the secretary of 'Homeland Security' were born.\n\
Need decompose: Yes\n\
Template_type: combination\n\n\
\
Question: List the states both in 'tb1' and 'tb2'.\n\
Need decompose: No\n\
\
Question: What are the names of all stations that in 'tb1' but not in 'tb2'?\n\
Need decompose: No\n\n\
